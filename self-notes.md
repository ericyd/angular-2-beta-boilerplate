# Folder explanations

* app: contains the javascript files compiled from our typescript source files.  Do not touch!
* assets: just contains scss code for now
* dev: contains typescript files.  This is where we work most of the time.  Re-write typescript logic here.  boot.ts file starts our application (will be explained more later)
* src: contains css files compiled from scss in assets.  Do not touch!
* typings: can ignore it.  Contains info for typescript

Note: the main file index.html is the only html file ever sent to the server.  Since angular apps are single page applications, everything else is done in the browser
